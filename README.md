###### Each time a different onion service is created, that being the case, if trying to connect right after the creation, a minute or two may be needed given the fact the onion service may still be having a proper integration to the tor network

Secure one-to-one communication, opsec focused
###### Maybe n-to-n someday, but no plans for now, given the fact this application is intended to be small

## Development environment
compile_flags.txt is for [usage with clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/design/compile-commands#compilation-databases)<br>
The c standard being used is a dialect from c17, that being gnu17

## Building
### Dependencies
- gcc
- [libcrypto3](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/crypto.html) (From openssl3) header files
- make (Or run the build command from the Makefile directly)
#### Fedora 39
```bash
sudo dnf install openssl-devel openssl-libs
```
#### Debian 12
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libssl3
```

To build:
```bash
$ make
```
The result will be at ./buid/donttrust
## Installation
Download and install the package of choice at the [releases page](https://github.com/Alvorada9999/dont_trust/releases)
## Usage

- Press "ESC" to change between "EDIT" and "VIEW" modes
- Press "j" to go down and "k" to go up
- Press "ENTER" to send the message

### You must provide your rsa private key and the rsa public key from your peer:
##### Dear tor users, "PGP keys" can be used as long the key is RSA, [which is the default algorithm for key generation in software like GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#new_key_algo) and many others
```bash
$ donttrust --pKey "./client_private_key_path.txt" --pubKey "./peer_public_key_path.pem"
```
###### The file type does not matter but the keys must be [PEM encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail#Format)
###### The possible sizes are those supported by [libcrypto3](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man7/crypto.html) from [openssl3](https://www.openssl.org/)

### Connecting
##### To connect to an ipv4 address:
```bash
$ donttrust -t 192.168.0.1
```
###### The address must be human readable
##### To connect to an onion address:
```bash
$ donttrust -o vww6ybal4bd7szmgncyruucpgfkqahzddi37ktceo3ah7ngmcopnpyyd.onion
```

### Listening for connections
##### To listen for normal ones:
```bash
$ donttrust ...
```
###### Just dont use any connection option, that being "-t" and "-o"
##### To listen for onion ones:
Before that, do this first time setup:<br>
1 - Generate a hashed password for control port access, <your_password> length must not be bigger than 1000:
```bash
$ tor --hash-password <your_password>
```
2 - On your ["torrc" file](https://support.torproject.org/tbb/tbb-editing-torrc/), add the following:
```bash
ControlPort 9051
HashedControlPassword <The result from the above command>
```
3 - Reload the configs if tor is running:
```bash
$ sudo kill -s SIGHUP <tor process id>
```
<br>

Just provide your password
```bash
$ donttrust --torControlPassword <your_password>
```

## Protocol Specification

Runs on top of tcp, there are 2 commands available:
###### A command is considered a network byte order 8 bits unsigned integer sent over the tcp byte stream

### 0x01 = Starts a message
After which should be on the following order:<br>

- An unsigned 32 bit number in network byte order, that's the message code (Both peers must start as 0, incrementing it's value by 1 for each new message)
- An unsigned 32 bit number in network byte order containing the cipher text size in bytes
- The initialization vector used to decrypt the cipher text, a sequence of 16 bytes
- The private key encrypted session key (AES in this case) used to decrypt the ciphertext, a sequence of 256 bytes
- The cipher text, up to a maximum of 65552 bytes length

### 0x02 = Starts a message confirmation
After which should be on the following order:<br>

- An unsigned 32 bit number in network byte order, that's the number of confirmations codes
- n unsigned 32 bit numbers in network byte order, each being a message code from a particular message received from the peer

## Customization

### Changing button for application mode change:<br>
There are 2, "VIEW" and "EDIT", the default button for changing is the 0x1B ASCII code (ESC button) <br>
Update "STATUS_CHANGE_BUTTON" at "src/common/common.h" to a desired ASCII code<br>

### Changing buttons for line moving:<br>
If the program is on "VIEW" mode, bytes coming from stdin are used to go up or down<br>
Update "UP_BUTTON" or "DOWN_BUTTON" at "src/common/common.h" to a desired ASCII code, the defaults are 'k' for "UP_BUTTON" and 'j' for "DOWN_BUTTON"<br><br>

###### For the following color reletad changes, refer to [some terminal 256 color ids table](https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797#256-colors)
### Changing background color:
Update "TERMINAL_BACKGROUND_COLOR_ID" from "src/common/common.h" to a desired terminal color id<br>

### Changing status line color:
Update "STATUS_LINE_TERMINAL_COLOR_CODE" from "src/common/common.h" to a desired terminal color id<br>
The default is "27" (Some blue tone)

### Changing sent messages color:
##### Not yet received by peer
Update the value of "PEER_NOT_RECEIVED_TERMINAL_BACKGROUND_COLOR_ID" from "src/common/common.h"<br>
The default is "196" (Some red tone)
##### Already received by peer
Update the value of "PEER_RECEIVED_TERMINAL_BACKGROUND_COLOR_ID" from "src/common/common.h"<br>
The default is "41" (Some green tone)

### Changing received messages color:
Update the value of "RECEIVED_TERMINAL_BACKGROUND_COLOR_ID" from "src/common/common.h"<br>
The default is "232" (Black)

## Motivation, philosophy and goals

- The need for information confidentiality
- Guarantee that the software does only what is intended
- No time to manually check the code of big open source projects
- No need for large communication protocols
- Very organized codebase files, easy to understand and hack
- Secure by default
- Minimal dependencies
